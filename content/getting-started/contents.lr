The Tor Styleguide is based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. We are currently implementing [v4.0.0-beta.2](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/tag/v4.0.0-beta.2).


To use the Tor styleguide you can download our [css style](https://oniongit.eu/infra/styleguide/tree/master/assets/static) and import it in your project. Alternatively, you can also clone this repository and use our SASS files. [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) is a CSS extension language. Bootstrap and this styleguide are based on [v3.5.4](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_CHANGELOG.html#3_5_4__15_December_2017_).

<p class="purple">
If you want to use SASS you can download the complete archive for the [styleguide](https://oniongit.eu/infra/styleguide). The [scss folder under assets](https://oniongit.eu/infra/styleguide/tree/master/assets/scss) contains all the sass files. Since we use bootstrap, we only add a few styles without modifying bootstrap core or definying new elements whenever possible. These are [_tor_variables.scss](https://oniongit.eu/infra/styleguide/blob/master/assets/scss/_tor-variables.scss) and [_tor.scss](https://oniongit.eu/infra/styleguide/blob/master/assets/scss/_tor.scss). These are imported in the main bootstrap scss file and compiled into the final css.
</p>


Bootstrap contains a few JavaScript libraries for extra interaction with the DOM. We use these libraries but do not add extra JavaScript. You might notice that if you run Tor browser with *high security mode*, JavaScript is disabled by default. This styleguide is designed to also work for users using Tor browse in *high security mode*, so that only few elements are affected if you disabled JavaScript.

This styleguide has been built using [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/). Lektor is a static content management system. You can build this yourself by [installing Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/downloads/).
